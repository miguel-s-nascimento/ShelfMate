### 2.2 How to Run the Chatbot

In order to run the streamlit app, the following steps must be taken.
1. Initializate a terminal.
2. Activate the dedicated conda environment.
3. Run: streamlit run app.py

**The deployed app is available [here](https://shelfmate.streamlit.app)** <br>
We created this public repository to deploy the Streamlit app online. <br>
As part of this process, we uploaded the database to SQLiteCloud. Any changes made to the database are now saved directly online. <br>

### 3.1 Database Overview and Schema Diagram

The database schema for our chatbot consists of 9 tables and was created automatically with DBeaver by importing the .db file obtained from the sqlite script.

![Database Diagram](images/databse.png)

**Primary keys** are identified in bold and foreign keys were defined on the script and are as follows:
 - fav_genres(username), favorite_authors(username) and read_list(username) reference users(username).
 - fav_genres(genre_id), authors(top_genre), books_genres(genre_id) reference genres(genre_id).
 - fav_authors(author_id), authors_books(author_id) reference authors(author_id).
 - books_genres(book_id), authors_books(book_id), read_list(book_id) reference books(book_id).

![Foreign keys Diagram](images/database2.png)

Example of foreign keys of username in DBeaver.

**Relationships**  
By using junction/bridge tables to solve cases with books with multiple authors or genres, or allowing users to have more than one favorite author or genre, every relationship in this schema is a One-to-Many relationship, instead of having Many-to-Many relationships. 



### 3.2 Table Descriptions

 - **Users:** The users table is essential for a personalized experience, secure authentication,
 and understanding user preferences. This includes storing details like username, password,
 gender, email, and district, which helps tailor content and recommendations.
 
 - **Genres:** The genres table is a reference table that matches an id to all available book
 genres, serving as a baseline to other 3 tables. It plays a key role in content organization
 and search functionality.

 - **Books:** The books table is at the core of the database, storing information like title,
 description, publication date, and page number (the latter generated artificially). It facilitates
 efficient book discovery and enables analysis of the book catalog.
 
 - **Authors:** This table contains information about authors, including their names and their
 primary genre (extracted from the books dataset), supporting better content categorization
 and author-specific recommendations for users.
 
 - **Favorite Authors:** The favorite authors table links users to their preferred authors, helping
 track user interests and enabling personalized content suggestions based on author
 preferences.
 
 - **Favorite Genres:** This table associates users with their preferred genres, allowing the
 system to recommend books and authors that match their interests and enhance their
 overall experience.

 - **Books_Genres:** Books are linked to their respective genres through this table (supporting
 multi-genre books), ensuring accurate categorization and making it easier to search for
 books within a specific genre.

 - **Authors_Books:** This table connects authors with the books they have written (supporting
 multi-author books), helping track bibliographies and supporting author-specific searches
 and recommendations.

 - **Read List:** The read list tracks the books a user has interacted with, storing data on user
 ratings and whether a book was finished. This enables the system to improve
 recommendation algorithms and understand user behavior

## 5. Intention Router

### 5.1 Intention Router Implementation

- **Message Generation**:  
 The messages for each user intention were generated using a synthetic data generation process. This approach utilized a synthetic_data_chain to produce responses based on the specified user intention and its corresponding description. For some intentions, specific details like books, genres, or authors were added to the description to enhance relevance and personalization. The process used ChatOpenAI as the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) with a configuration of temperature=0.0 and model="gpt-4o-mini", ensuring consistency and precision in responses. By providing relevant inputs such as k=50 and user_intentions, the synthetic data chain generated contextually appropriate messages. These messages were then processed, structured, and stored in a file for future reference and use.

### 5.2 Semantic Router Training

- **Hyperparameters**:  
  The semantic router utilizes the HuggingFaceEncoder() for encoding. The aggregation method applied is 'sum', and the parameter top_k=6 is used to select the six most relevant results.

### 5.3 Post-Processing for Accuracy Improvement

- **Post-Processing Techniques**:  
  To enhance the initial accuracy achieved, we implemented several changes to improve the router's performance. First, we reviewed and refined the prompts for each chain in our synthetic_intentions notebook, resolving conflicts between overlapping chains. While this step led to some improvement, it was not sufficient on its own. As a result, we introduced two additional chains designed specifically to verify and determine the appropriate chain for the user inputs. These adjustments collectively contributed to better accuracy.

## 6. Intention Router Accuracy Testing Results

### Methodology

1. **Message Creation**:

   - It was generated at least 50 synthetic messages per intention, totaling 750 messages.
   - Additionally, it was generated 59 small-talk messages related to our company and 51 off-topic messages unrelated to the company, labeled as "None."

2. **Data Splitting**:

   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets (75/25) using stratification, ensuring that each intention was evenly represented in both sets for a balanced distribution.

3. **Training the Semantic Router**:

   - The train_test_split function was used to train the semantic router, resulting in accuracy scores of 93.14% for the training set and 88.65% for the testing set.

4. **Post-Processing with LLM**:

   - As previously stated, no additional refinement using Large Language Models (LLMs) or custom algorithms was integrated into the pipeline.

5. **Reporting Results**:
   - The accuracy was calculated as the percentage of correct responses out of the total inputs for each intention, as presented in the following table.
